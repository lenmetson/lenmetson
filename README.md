# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year BSc Politics Student at LSE. I'm interested in applying research methods in the social sciences. Right now I am particularly interested in political behaviour, social movements, social norms and postive behaviour to out-groups. I have also done projects on using textual analysis to analyse legislators' behaviour. I am currently using Twitter data to write my undergraduate dissertation on social movements and when they reach out to outsiders for help.

## Projects
