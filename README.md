# Hi there 👋

I am a third year BSc Politics Student at LSE. I'm interested in applying research methods in the social sciences. Right now I am particularly interested in political behaviour, social movements, social norms and postive behaviour to out-groups. I have also done projects on using textual analysis to analyse legislators' behaviour. I am currently using Twitter data to write my undergraduate dissertation on social movements and when they reach out to outsiders for help.

## Projects 
* 🔎 Mini-project: [Gender representation of women in the Scottish Parliament](https://lenmetson.github.io/MSP-gender-speeches/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/lenmetson/MSP-gender-speeches))
* 🧑‍🏫 PSA Undergraduate Conference 2021: Examining Regional-Focus in UK Parliamentary Speech: Electoral Vulnerability and Regional Representation ([Slides](https://github.com/lenmetson/lenmetson/blob/34b00e5bf26b08b14b819b2167e5a86c14742331/files/psa_presentation_metson.pdf))
