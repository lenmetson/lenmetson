# Hi there 👋

## 👨 About me  

My name is Len and I am a third year BSc Politics Student at LSE. My pronouns are he/him. 

🤔 I'm interested in methodology and political behaviour. 

* 🧰 Methodologically I am interested in computational textual analysis, data science, experiments and natural experiments.
* 🔎 Substantively I am interested in social movements, persuasion, prejudice reduction, partisanship and misinformation.

I have also done projects on using textual analysis to analyse legislators' behaviour. I am currently using Twitter data to write my undergraduate dissertation on social movements and when they reach out to outsiders for help.
