# Hi there 👋

## 👨 About me  

I am an MRes/PhD student at LSE Goverment, supervised by Florian Foos and Mathias Poertner. I previously completed an MSc in Politics Research student at Oxford's DPIR where I was supervised by [Rachel Bernhard](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/rachel-bernhard-0). I am interested in researching political campaigns and social influence using field experiments and data science methods. I also take a keen interest in the open-science movement and how social science can be made more reliable, robust and ultimately useful for improving society.
