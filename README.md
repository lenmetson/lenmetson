# Hi there 👋

👨 My name is Len and I am a third year BSc Politics Student at LSE. My pronouns are he/him. 

🤔 I'm interested in methodology and political behaviour. Methodologically - textual analysis, experiments and natural experiments. Substantively - social movements, persuasion, prejudice reduction and misinformation.

I have also done projects on using textual analysis to analyse legislators' behaviour. I am currently using Twitter data to write my undergraduate dissertation on social movements and when they reach out to outsiders for help.
