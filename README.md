# Hi there 👋

## 👨 About me  

I am a MSc Politics Research student at Oxford's DPIR. I am interested in researching political campaigns using field experiments and data science methods. I also take a keen interest in the open-science movement and how social science can be made more reliable, robust and ultimately useful for improving society.
