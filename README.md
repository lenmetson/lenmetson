# Hi there 👋

## 👨 About me  

I am an MRes/PhD student at LSE Government, supervised by [Florian Foos](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/florian-foos) and [Mathias Poertner](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/mathias-poertner). My research looks at how political behaviour is shaped by individuals' social networks and environments, particularly in the field of political campaigns. Methodologically, I am interested in field experiments and computational social science techniques.
